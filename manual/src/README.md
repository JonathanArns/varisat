# Varisat

Varisat is a [CDCL][cdcl] based SAT solver written in rust. Given a boolean
formula in [conjunctive normal form][cnf], it either finds a variable
assignment that makes the formula true or finds a proof that this is
impossible.

Varisat is open source software. You can find the Varisat project on [GitHub].

Varisat is available as a rust library ([`varisat` on
crates.io][crate-varisat]) and as a command line solver ([`varisat-cli` on
crates.io][crate-varisat-cli]).

In addition to this user manual, Varisat comes with an [API
documentation][api-docs].
